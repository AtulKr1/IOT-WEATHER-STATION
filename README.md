# IoT Weather Station

The IoT Weather Station is a comprehensive weather monitoring system that utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller's capabilities to collect and display real-time weather data through a dedicated website. This project integrates various sensors to measure temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and more. The ESP32's built-in server is leveraged to host a user-friendly web interface that provides users with immediate access to the current weather conditions.


## Features

- Seamless integration of ESP32 microcontroller for data collection and web hosting.
- Real-time weather data acquisition from multiple sensors.
- Intuitive web interface accessible from any device with a browser.
- Scalable architecture for potential future expansions and improvements.


## Components
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Temperature and humidity sensor
- Barometric pressure sensor
- Rain sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power source (e.g., USB cable, battery)
